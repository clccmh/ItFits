  <h1>It Fits</h1>
  <h2>By: Carter Hay</h2>
  <br/>
  <h3>Type of Game and Tools</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        It Fits is a puzzle game written with the tool
        <a href="https://www.garagegames.com/products/torque-2d">Torque2D</a>
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Setup:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      In order to play It Fits, navigate to the 'src' folder, and open
      <b>Torque2D.exe.</b>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Playing:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        The object of It Fits is to place all of the shapes from the pile on the
        right, onto the board on the left.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        At the top right corner, there are three lifelines, that can only be used
        once in the game. These are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Expand the board
        </li>
        <li>
          Delete one random block
        </li>
        <li>
          Skip the level
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        To move the shapes, simply drag your mouse from the pile over to the board.
        It Fits will give you a shape from the pile, and the shapes will snap to
        the grid on the board as you drag them.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        In order to win levels in It Fits, you should try to minimize the spaces
        on the board that cannot be reached. This is similar to the mechanic in
        the game Tetris.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        In It Fits, there are 5 levels. While every level can be completed without
        lifelines, it is easiest to complete the game if you use one lifeline on
        level 3, and another lifeline on level 5.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        If you cannot complete the game, or get stuck on a level, plese reference this
        video. Please note, that the color of peices, and order of peices is randomized.
      </p>
